Usage
-----

Server: python server.py [port]
Client: python client.py [server-ip] [server-port] [num-requests]


To think about (tweaks)
-----------------------

- in client.py, there is a WINDOW_SIZE parameter. Adjust to change how many messages you want to send asyncrhonously.
- in server.py, if you are dealing with more than 1000 clients, may want to change to 'nonblocking' instead of 'threaded' server type
